# desktop cleaner

I have a pretty messy desktop at times, particularly when I'm working. I made a little script that grabs any files on my desktop, creates a folder in Documents named after the date-modified metadata of the file (assuming such a folder doesn't already exist), and throws the file into that folder. This makes it easier for me to organize (or further ignore lol) these files later on. The config file grabs environment variables set in my bash profile. Also added a downloads env variable for further refactoring.
